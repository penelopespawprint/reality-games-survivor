## 2. Verify Previous Fixes Are Working
Based on earlier feedback, verify these items work correctly:

- [ ] **Sticky Navigation** - Nav bar should be fixed at top when scrolling
- [ ] **Footer displays** - Footer component shows on all pages
- [ ] **Scoring page** - Shows "Earn Points"/"Lose Points" not numeric values
- [ ] **League chat** - Chat appears in league overview (not separate tab)
- [ ] **Home page renders** - Works for both authenticated and unauthenticated users

## 3. Quick Fixes Needed
- Replace "Tribe" with "Team" in pre-merge challenges section
- Test the site to confirm all previous fixes are live
